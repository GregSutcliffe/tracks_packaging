Description: Open source Rails Getting Things Done (GTD) implementation.
 Tracks is a web-based application to help you implement David Allenâ€™s
 Getting Things Done methodology. It was built using Ruby on Rails, and
 comes with a built-in webserver (WEBrick), so that you can run it on
 your own computer if you like. It can be run on any platform on which
 Ruby can be installed, including Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Tracks is
 Open Source, free and licensed under the GNU GPL.
